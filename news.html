          AXLE brings together a diverse group of
          researchers covering hardware, database
          kernel and visualisation experts all
          focused on solving the needs of
          extremely large data analysis.

    <p>The AXLE Project's second General Assembly took place in Amsterdam. The two-day meeting was very productive and was well 
attended by all partners.  The agenda was tightly packed, and covered partner overviews, work package updates and an Industrial Advisory Body (IAB) review. 
<p>
The IAB review was very well received by all partners, and focused on the results that might be of interest to the industry at large. The partners were in agreement that the AXLE project will be of great benefit to the database management sector (and many others). 
<p>
The partners were rewarded for their efforts with a delicious meal on board a canal boat which provided a fascinating tour of Amsterdam. Being in such close confines with each other was a great way to get to know one another better. There is an easy rapport amongst the partners and this is evident in both social settings and around the conference table.

      <b>17th and 18th April 2013</b> AXLE General Assembly

      <p>Barcelona Super Computers hosted the AXLE project's first General Assembly on 17th and 18th April 2013, and provided an

opportunity for all 5 partners to celebrate the achievements made in the first six months of the 

project. These included procuring most of the hardware needed for the project and the launch of the 

project website.
      <p>With a busy agenda, the conference was a time of partner updates, problem solving sessions and 

strategising. The partners agreed a strategy of dissemination to provide ongoing information about 

the project across several media, the first of which was a press release at the end of April which 

announced the AXLE project to the online database community. 

      <p>An evening tour of the Casa Batllo (<a href="http://www.casabatllo.es">http://www.casabatllo.es</a> - a Gaudi architectural masterpiece) was an excellent backdrop against which the partners could relax and learn more about one another. 


      <p>And a visit to The Barcelona Super Computer  was a great way to start the final day. Very interesting juxtapositioning of massive hardware and religious architecture.

      <p>This two day meeting further enhanced partner understanding of the project, and one another, clearly illustrating the power and importance of collaborative projects.

      <b>1st and 2nd November 2012</b> AXLE Kick Off Meeting.
      
    <p>
      A very successful and informative Kick Off meeting was held in Heathrow,
      London, UK with 17 attendees from all 5 partners.
      Each partner introduced their organisation, people and why they are a
      partner in the AXLE project, as well as initial discussions of the plan
      of action for each Work Package.
      
    <p>
      On the first evening everyone attended a celebratory meal in Eton, and
      enjoyed getting to know the team.
